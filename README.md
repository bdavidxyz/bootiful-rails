# Bootstrap theme for Rails

## Pains behind the project

Bootstrap is the most well-known, used, starred CSS framework, so it's good not to feel alone when you have to code a full UI design system from scratch.

However :

 - Bootstrap is component-based only : for example, no landing page neither blog article are included in the framework.
 - There is no "unstyled" or "default" theme for Bootstrap,
 - There are no free and open-sourced theme for Bootstrap and Rails,
 - Free themes, when not bloated, are quickly obsolete,
 - Good themes are not free.

## Design principles

  - Provide a fully usable webapp / website with Bootstrap
  - Be as close as possible from the original Bootstrap v5, i.e. there should be as few theme customisation as possible
  - Be up-to-date with the last Bootstrap v5 version
  - Ability to work with the Webpacker gem, but also any other website - so SCSS-only modification are preferred
  - Give to the developer some ways to extend/customize/modify Bootstrap
  - Priority is given to the most classic things you can find in any website : landing page, blog, /admin section.
  - Other parts are also welcome, but will have less priority
